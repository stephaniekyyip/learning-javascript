    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // Wes, Wes
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2); // wesley, Wes

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // Both the arrays, team and players, now have 'Lux' in index 3.

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'hey';

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99; // original object is also changed b/c captain is a reference to the original, not actually a copy

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99}); // creates a new object with the properties of an existing object, along with any new propeties or modifications of the properties for the new object
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}; // does not exist yet

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age: 100,
      social : {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); // copy of the original object, but if you try to change twitter or facebook (nested within social) in the copy, the original will change too.

    // need a clone deep function in order to copy all the levels of an object

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); // the "poor man's" deep clone
